    Fancy Bear is widely attributed to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, based on the evidence of their targets, methods, and infrastructure. Several cybersecurity firms, such as CrowdStrike, FireEye, and Mandiant, have said with a medium to high level of confidence that Fancy Bear is associated with the GRU12 In 2018, an indictment by the United States Special Counsel identified Fancy Bear as GRU Unit 261653 The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other governments have also publicly accused Russia of being behind Fancy Bear’s activities1 However, Russia has denied any involvement or connection with Fancy Bear1
